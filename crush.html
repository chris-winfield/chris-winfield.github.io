<h2>Crush</h2>
<p>
too many snacks in bed and the ants </br>
from the kitchen moved upstairs to my room.</br>
i think they live under my small bookcase</br>
on my bedside table. there must be</br>
crumbs there or something. i emptied the shelves</br>
and cleaned. i used a spray bottle of</br>
vinegar water on a tip from google.</br>
that didn’t seem to work. </br>
</br>
so i gave up on negotiating with the ants and</br>
started crushing them using the</br>
flat edge of a penny. their bodies are</br>
typically gone the next time i look.</br>
i’m imagining the ants eating their</br>
dead or having a serious military</br>
funeral for the fallen.</br>
</br>
i have become really good at killing ants</br>
with the penny. you told me that you hate ants.</br>
i will kill all the ants for you so that</br>
you will be more comfortable.</br>
