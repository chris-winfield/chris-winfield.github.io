<h2>About</h2>
<p>I was born in southeast Virginia to a aircraft maintenance logistician and a nurse technician. I grew up in a suburban neighborhood a half-mile from the Atlantic Ocean. I enjoyed books, Nintendo, and undersupervised access to the nascent Internet.</p>

<p>By 17, I'd focused all my attention on music, but by 20, that had led me to rediscover my childhood love of language and writing.</p>

<p>In between my nonconsecutive terms at Virginia Tech, I moved to Richmond, Los Angeles, and Norfolk. In 2020, I proudly received my B.A..</p>

<p>I now live in Blacksburg, VA with my wife. I like literature, accumulating guitars, rock music, 20<sup>th</sup> century and contemporary art, sports, and the <i>Financial Times</i>.</p>
