<p>Atom is a <em>text editor</em>, and that has its benefits: limiting distractions; running quickly and smoothly; and customization. But creative writing often wants for more, even if it's only for the writer's benefit. <em>Markdown</em> can turn raw text into that something more.</p>

<p><em>Markdown</em> is a formatting language, which means at times it feels like coding, but its designed to be lightweight and easy to use. Atom and its packages will do much of the heavy lifting, as well.</p>

<p>Open one of the .md files with some text in it. Open the command palette and search for <em>markdown preview</em>. This will open a new pane with the raw text processed with markdown. At this point, with no formatting, all this will do is change the font.</p>

<p>Now, highlight some text, perhaps a title, and select one of the header buttons on the tool bar that came with the <em>packages</em> tool-bar and tool-mark-markdown-writer: <strong>H1</strong>, <strong>H2</strong>, or <strong>H3</strong>. The preview will update after a short pause.</p>

<p>Atom will automatically format the highlighted text with the selected function. Try bold, italics, and anything else to get a feel for Markdown. On the menu bar, under &quot;Packages&quot; and &quot;Markdown Writer,&quot; more functions are available. An in-depth guide, including a cheatsheet, for Markdown is available <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/" title="Markdown Guide">online</a>.</p>

<p>Once finished with markdown formatting, open the command palette and search &quot;pandoc convert&quot;. <em>Pandoc</em> converts between different file extensions, so that these .md files can become .docx files that might be required when submitting work. If successful, the converted file will be placed in the same directory in the repository as the original file. Some formats, like pdf, will fail without installing an additional package, but pandoc will include this in an error.</p>

<p>With Markdown and Pandoc, Atom can at least come close to most word processors without sacrificing any of its writer-friendly features. The next section <a href="exploring.html">explores</a> the advantages that GitHub provides.</p>
