<p>With Atom now corresponding with GitHub all on its own, the focus now shifts to sharpening it as a writing implement. From the menu bar at the top of the screen, select &quot;File&quot; and then &quot;Settings.&quot; The first category is &quot;Core Settings.&quot; Most of these settings can be left alone for creative writing, though &quot;Restore Previous Windows on Start&quot; may be toggled off for a clean slate when starting a new session.</p>

<p>Under the &quot;Editor&quot; category, changing the font and font size, if desired, can take away some of the unpolished feeling of the text editor, as the default lives closer to a typewriter than to a modern word processor. <strong>Turning on &quot;Soft Wrap&quot;</strong> will force the editor to make paragraphs look like paragraphs instead of long lines that need to be scrolled across horizontally.</p>

<p>Now navigate to &quot;Packages.&quot; <em>Packages</em> add functionality to Atom, similar to extensions on a web browser. Atom comes installed with dozens of packages, a good deal of them aimed towards coders. Many of these packages make writing in different programming languages easier by popping up suggestions in certain contexts. These may be disabled here if they prove annoying.</p>

<p>In &quot;Themes,&quot; the appearance of Atom may be adjusted. The dilemma is between <em>dark</em> or <em>light</em> themes. The former generally lessens eye strain while the latter makes for a more familiar experience.</p>

</figure>

<p>Select <strong>&quot;Install&quot;</strong> to install new packages. The Atom user community develops most of these. To begin, search &quot;word count&quot;. The first two packages returned are &quot;word-count&quot; and &quot;count-word.&quot; &quot;Word-count&quot; is <em>deprecated</em>, meaning that its development has not kept up with Atom, making it unusable. However, &quot;count-word&quot; appears correct. Select &quot;Install&quot; for &quot;count-word&quot; and Atom will download and install it in a few moments.</p>

<p>After that, install the following packages:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>markdown-writer</em>, which assists with Markdown, the formatting language used to make finished work more attractive</li>
<li><em>pandoc-convert</em>, which converts the .md files to other formats</li>
<li><em>tool-bar</em></li>
<li><em>tool-bar-markdown-writer</em>, which works with tool-bar and markdown-writer to make a friendly toolbar at the top of Atom</li>
</ul>

<p>There are many other useful and optional packages for writers, including <em>typewriter</em>, <em>zen</em>, <em>atom-beautify</em>, and <em>linter-write-good</em> (a linter is a programming tool that identifies syntax errors and style problems in a language; this one serves that purpose for <em>English</em>).</p>

<p>Once everything installs, consider Atom fully outfitted for creative writing. Now begins the process of using it effectively. Close the settings tab and look at the interface for Atom. In this set-up process, it may be apparent that Atom splits itself into multiple <em>panes</em>, or groups of tabs. For example, selecting the GitHub or Git buttons in the lower right corner opens the GitHub/Git pane on the far right, which divides into two <em>tabs</em>, which work the same as tabs in a web browser, for those two functions. The left side always contains the Project pane, which displays the structure of the repository.</p>

</figure>

<p>In the Project pane, open the file from the first commit and then make a new file and open it. The two files open in two tabs. <strong>Tabs can be transformed into panes</strong> to view two files side by side. Click and drag the second file's tab from the tab bar and move the cursor down to the pane. Notice the shadow effect. Releasing the mouse will create a new pane with that tab in the shadowed position, which can make a horizontal or vertical split. This provides an ideal arrangement for revision and editing work.</p>

<p>Click-dragging the last tab in a pane back to the tab bar of another pane eliminates the empty pane. Notice that tabs can also be rearranged within a pane this way. The size of panes can be adjusted by moving the mouse over the border line between two panes.</p>

<p>The repository folder view also allows for powerful manipulation. Files and folders can be renamed and moved. Double-clicking a file will open it permanently in a new tab, while a single click will open it in a tab until another file is selected. In a complex project with notes, character sketches, and an outline, the project tab becomes invaluable.</p>

<p>The different colors in the folder view highlight differences in the local repository from the committed version, which can be useful when writing comments at the end of a session.</p>

<p>The most powerful tool in Atom above these others is the <em>command palette</em>. The command palette gives quick access to any function in any installed package of Atom. Open the command palette by using control-shift-p (on Windows) or command-shift-p (on macOS) and type &quot;count.&quot; The first option that appears is the <em>toggle</em> for the count-word tool. A toggled option means that its command must be pressed again to be turned off. The command palette also uses a toggle.</p>

<p>When in doubt, use the command palette. In the next section, <a href="markdown.html">Markdown</a> will be used to turn written text into beautiful documents.</p>
