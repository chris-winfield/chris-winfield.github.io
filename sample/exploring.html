<p>The primary reason why anyone, whether a coder or creative writer, uses GitHub is for the <em>version control</em> function of the underlying software, <em>Git</em>. Version control tracks changes between commits, allowing them to be compared or restored. Each commit remembers the structure of the repository at the time of commit. For writers, this means nothing gets lost in an overwritten file or misplaced on a shelf.</p>

<p>In the web browser, navigate to the repository on GitHub.com. This shows the latest commit with the comment for each individual folder or file. Examine the buttons here: some are code-centric, but select &quot;commits&quot; below the &quot;Code&quot; button. This is the complete history of the repository. Older files can be downloaded directly, or text can be compared between two versions of a file.</p>

<h4 id="collaborators">Collaborators</h4>

<p>The free version of GitHub allows for a limited number of <em>collaborators</em> on a private repository. In a software development context, collaborators are the people who work on the project's code. They can create pull requests to create new branches which can later be merged back into the main branch. For a writer, this functionality can be given to share work with trusted readers and editors. A different branch could be used for copyediting or comments, which don't necessarily need to be merged into the main branch of your repository. To add collaborators, navigate to Settings on GitHub and select &quot;Manage access.&quot;</p>

<h4 id="issues">Issues</h4>

<p>The <em>Issues</em> tab serves as a place where, in a software development cycle, bugs can be noted and discussed. Writers can take advantage of this in the same way, creating a centralized, indelible list of the problems that writers have. Collaborators can see, create, and discuss issues on GitHub as well, so that no conversation goes without context. Issues may eventually be <em>closed</em> when they are resolved.</p>

<p>There are very few rules for how GitHub can be utilized. Code, like creative writing, is never finished after one pass, which is why tools like these exist. Experiment and follow new features on GitHub to further ease the revision process.</p>
