<h2>This is my technical writing sample.</h2>

<p>These documents aim to present technical software, GitHub and Atom, to a non-technical audience, creative writers. In my experience, creative writers tend to be curious, intelligent, and interested in process, but often a little scared of any technology that seems too advanced. They need a nudge to get past this. They're good at following instructions to the letter. They know more than they think they know.</p>

<p>The limitations of these documents are that they can't cover every use case. Readers who encounter errors won't receive many solutions here. However, the procedure is clean and correct.</p>
