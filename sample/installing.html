<p>GitHub Desktop will be the first step to a simple implementation of Git for creative writers. <a href="https://desktop.github.com/" title="GitHub Desktop Download">Download</a> and install GitHub Desktop. From the Welcome screen, select &quot;Sign In to GitHub.com&quot; and return to your web browser. After logging into GitHub, authorize it. After this, GitHub Desktop will open again. On the &quot;Configure Git&quot; screen that appears, leave it as &quot;Use my GitHub account name and email address.&quot; Select Finish.</p>

<p>On the right side of the &quot;Let's get started!&quot; screen, select the repository and then select &quot;Clone&quot; below that. <em>Cloning</em> a repository will create a folder on your computer which will contain everything your repository on GitHub contains. GitHub Desktop will fill in the URL of your repository. Below that is the clone location. <strong>Because issues can arise from moving this folder, keep it somewhere unobtrusive.</strong> After a successful clone, GitHub Desktop can be closed for the time being.</p>

<p><a href="https://atom.io/" title="Atom Download">Download</a> and install Atom. After it installs, close Atom and open GitHub Desktop once more. The repository will appear. From the menu bar at the top of the screen, navigate to &quot;Repository&quot; and select &quot;Open In Atom.&quot; A restart may be necessary if &quot;Open In Atom&quot; doesn't appear immediately. The repository and its local clone will open in Atom.</p>

<p>Close GitHub Desktop once more, and prepare to make the first <a href="committing.html">commit</a>.</p>
