<p>On <a href="https://github.com/signup" title="GitHub Signup">GitHub</a>, follow the on-screen instructions to register. There is both a paid and a <em>gratis</em> subscription to GitHub. For creative writing, the free version is more than adequate.</p>

<p>Once logged in, select &quot;Create repository&quot; on the left side of the screen.</p>

<p>The <em>repository</em> is the highest level of organization for projects on GitHub. Think of it as a big, empty file cabinet where notes, drafts, and other files will be organized. Give it a comfortable name, as it's best left unchanged going forward. Make the repository <em>private</em>. Regardless of the goal of the work, whether it's to be submitted or self-published, <strong>making the repository public will allow anyone to see the drafts and notes</strong> that are best left for scholars and biographers to study in retrospect. Private will allow for additional users, or <em>collaborators</em>, to join later.</p>

<p>None of the additional options, a README, .gitignore, or license, are necessary for creative writers. Select &quot;Create repository&quot; to finish.</p>

<p>With the repository created, it will list some options to begin utilizing the newly minted space. <strong>Git chiefly uses a command line interface</strong>, but in the next section, <a href="installing.html">GitHub Desktop and Atom</a> will make for an accessible and fully functional experience friendly to writers.</p>
