<p>The primary target of GitHub, a popular software collaboration and hosting platform, and Atom, a text editor developed by GitHub, is coders. Software engineers, web designers, game developers: coders. Most of the default features for GitHub and Atom make coding easier. For many of the same reasons these tools work so well for coding, creative writers benefit as well. While the initial set-up may appear daunting, contemporary computer users should face no issues. It will only take a few <em>commits</em>, or updates, to become fluent.</p>

<p>GitHub, with its ability to access files across multiple devices and <em>version control</em>, or revision tracking, forms the technological basis, while Atom serves as the writing implement. Atom is a <em>text editor</em>, and therefore will not always compare to more robust word processors, but its potential for customization provides the kind of fluidity so often necessary in the revision process.</p>
