<h2>This Will Make You Transform</h2>
<p>
you are now finding the metaphor of drifting down a river to be insufficient.</br>
because there is a vertical direction to consider.</br>
flow was extremely important to you, but all.</br>
you created for her was stagnation and disappointment. </br>

there are reasons for you to do things, like have conversations with others.</br>
people have different viewpoints. some live in other cities.</br>
some of them are just eighteen years old.</br>
you feel that you have matured up to a point but not enough yet. </br>

in your gut, there is a diverse biome.</br>
you want to ask her to marry you.</br>
you want to fuck and hang out three days a week for eight weeks.</br>
you are going to float in another direction. it doesn’t matter what you want.</br>
