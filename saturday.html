<h2>Saturday Morning</h2>
<p>you are waking up at 10 after going to sleep at 3.</br>
today you will simulate what it’s like to be a person.</br>
you will go to the mall without getting stoned first,</br>
that way you will find the returns desk without a problem.</br>
it won’t be uncomfortable for you to talk to anyone.</br>
there won’t be any questions about how you will get there from here</br>
as you are right now. you will be as steady as the google car on fresh pavement.</br>
you won’t be anything but extremely calm because you are laying in bed right now. </br>

you are receiving unsolicited texts from three people that</br>
normally don’t even remember to text you back.</br>
you still feel dissatisfied, but part of you appreciates the effort.</br>
people have busy schedules, and that will be always be true.</br>
when they don’t have schedules, they drink alcohol because they’re at least 21.</br>
one day everyone you know will be 21 or older.</br>
for now you will have to cope with human inconsistency.</br>
you only want to give others what you want them to give to you.</br>
